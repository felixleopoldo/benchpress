Benchpress [[1]](#1) is a [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow where structure learning (sometimes called causal discovery) algorithms, implemented in possibly different languages, can be executed and compared.
The computations scale seamlessly on multiple cores or *"... to server, cluster, grid and cloud environments, without the need to modify the workflow definition" - Snakemake*.
The documentation is found at https://benchpressdocs.readthedocs.io. 
<!-- [This](https://benchpressdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/json_overview.html#evaluation) section shows an overview of the supported evaluation methods. -->

The following main functionalities are provided by Benchpress 

* Benchmarks - Benchmark structure learning algorithms.
* Algorithm development - Benchmark your own algorithm along with the existing ones while developing.
* Data analysis - Estimate the underlying graph structure for your own dataset(s).
