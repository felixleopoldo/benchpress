This is a small scale simulation study from data scenario :ref:`V` where :ref:`pcalg_pc` and :ref:`dualpc` are compared side-by-side.
We consider data from 10 random `Bayesian network <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network>`_ models :math:`\{(G_i,\Theta_i)\}_{i=1}^{10}`, where each graph :math:`G_i` has :math:`p=80`` nodes and is sampled using the :ref:`pcalg_randdag` module.
The parameters :math:`\Theta_i` are sampled from the random linear Gaussian SEM using the :ref:`sem_params` module  with ``min`` =0.25, ``max`` =1.
We draw one standardised dataset :math:`\mathbf Y_i` of size :math:`n=300` from each of the models using the :ref:`iid`, module. 
The ``benchmark_setup`` section of this study is found in :numref:`pcvsdualpc`.

Results from the :ref:`benchmarks` and the :ref:`graph_true_stats` module, where we have focused on the undirected skeleton for evaluations since this is the part where the algorithms mainly differ.
More specifically, from :numref:`study_1/FPR_TPR_skel.png`, showing the `FP/P <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic>`_ and `TP/P <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic>`_, we see that the dual PC has superior performance for significance levels *alpha=0.05,0.01*.
Apart from the curves, the numbers in the plot indicates the seed number of the underlying dataset and models for each run.
We note that model with seed number 3 seems give to good results for both algorithms and looking into :numref:`study_1/graph_density_plot.png`, we note that the graph with seed number 3 corresponds to the one with the lowest graph density :math:`|E| / |V|`.
The box plots from  :numref:`study_1/elapsed_time_joint.png` shows the computational times for the two algorithms, where the outliers are labeled by the model seed numbers.
We note e.g., that seed number 1 gave a bit longer computational time for the standard PC algorithm and from :numref:`study_1/graph_density_plot.png` we find that the graph with seed number 1 has relatively high graph density.
The conclusion of the `F1 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score>`_ score plot in :numref:`study_1/F1_skel_joint.png`. are in line with the `FP/P <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic>`_ / `TP/P <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic>`_ results from :numref:`study_1/FPR_TPR_skel.png`.
