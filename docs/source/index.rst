Open-source causal discovery platform
#############################################################

Describing the relationship between the variables in a study domain and modelling
the data generating mechanism is a fundamental problem in many empirical sciences.
`Probabilistic graphical models <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model>`_ are one common approach to tackle the problem. 
Learning the graphical structure for such models, referred to as **causal discovery** and **structure learning** in general, is computationally challenging and a fervent
area of current research with a plethora of algorithms being developed. 
To facilitate the access to the different methods we present Benchpress, a scalable and platform-independent `Snakemake <https://snakemake.github.io/>`_ workflow to **run**, **develop**, and to create reproducible **benchmarks**
of **structure learning algorithms** for probabilistic graphical models.
Benchpress is interfaced via a simple `JSON <https://www.json.org/json-en.html>`_-file, which makes it accessible for all users, while the code is
designed in a fully modular fashion to enable researchers to contribute additional methodologies. 
Benchpress  provides an interface to a large number of state-of-the-art
algorithms from libraries such as `BDgraph <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BDgraph/index.html>`_, `BiDAG <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BiDAG/index.html>`_, `bnlearn <https://www.bnlearn.com/>`_, `gCastle <https://github.com/huawei-noah/trustworthyAI/tree/master/gcastle>`_, `GOBNILP <https://bitbucket.org/jamescussens/gobnilp/src/master/>`_, `pcalg <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pcalg/index.html>`_, `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org>`_, `TETRAD <https://www.ccd.pitt.edu/>`_, and `trilearn <https://github.com/felixleopoldo/trilearn>`_    as well as a variety of methods for data generating models and performance evaluation. 
Alongside user-defined models and randomly
generated datasets, the workflow also includes a number of standard datasets and graphical models from the literature.

* 2024-12-26: Benchpress 2.12.0. This version introduces the :ref:`pyagrum` module, providing access to the `pyAgrum <https://agrum.gitlab.io/>`_ library's structure learning capabilities for discrete valued Bayesian networks. 
* 2024-12-16: Benchpress 2.11.0. This version introduces the :ref:`bips_tpc` module, based on the temporal PC (`tPC <https://github.com/bips-hb/tpc>`_) and the `micd <https://github.com/bips-hb/micd>`_ package. It enables causal discovery through the PC algorithm allowing for :ref:`edge_constraints`, mixed data, and missing data handling. Thanks `Leibniz-Institut für Präventionsforschung und Epidemiologie – (BIPS GmbH)  <https://github.com/bips-hb>`_. 
* 2024-11-30: Benchpress 2.10.0. This version includes algorithms from the `missing value PC (MVPC) <https://github.com/TURuibo/MVPC>`_ package for sampling data with missing values (:ref:`mvpc_gen_data`) and causal discovery (:ref:`mvpc`) in the presence of missing values.
* 2024-11-24: Benchpress 2.9.0. This version comes with three new major features. 

    I) The ability to incorporate background knowledge in terms of :ref:`edge_constraints`. Thanks to `Gomathi Lakshmanan <https://www.linkedin.com/in/gomathi-l/>`_ for this great feature. 
    II) The ability to specify multiple benchmark setups in the same config file (See :ref:`json_config`).             
    III) Generating DAGs using the `gCastle <https://github.com/huawei-noah/trustworthyAI/blob/master/gcastle/README.md>`_  package (:ref:`gcastle_dag`). Thanks to `Damian Machlanski <https://dmachlanski.com/>`_.

    To convert the config files (<2.9.0) to this new format run 
        
        .. prompt:: bash

            chmod +x scripts/utils/reformat_conf_files.py 
            workflow/scripts/utils/reformat_conf_files.py

* 2024-06-27: Benchpress 2.8.0. The new :ref:`graph_estimation` module enables graph estimation and plotting. It will replace the :ref:`graph_plots` module as it is faster an easier to use.

.. Note that this version requires that *old config files has to be adapted* to add ``edgeConstraints: null`` for the modules supporting it and change the ``benchmark_setup`` section to contain a list, where each item has a ``title`` key. To do this you may run the script .
