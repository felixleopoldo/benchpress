Describing the relationship between the variables in a study domain and modelling
the data generating mechanism is a fundamental problem in many empirical sciences.
Probabilistic graphical models are one common approach to tackle the problem. Learning the graphical structure for such models is computationally challenging and a fervent
area of current research with a plethora of algorithms being developed. To facilitate
the benchmarking of different methods we present Benchpress, a novel Snakemake workflow for producing scalable, reproducible, and platform-independent benchmarks
of structure learning algorithms for probabilistic graphical models. Benchpress is interfaced via a simple JSON-file, which makes it accessible for all users, while the code is
designed in a fully modular fashion to enable researchers to contribute additional methodologies. Benchpress currently provides an interface to a large number of state-of-the-art
algorithms from libraries such as `BDgraph <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BDgraph/index.html>`_, `BiDAG <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BiDAG/index.html>`_, `bnlearn <https://www.bnlearn.com/>`_, `gCastle <https://github.com/huawei-noah/trustworthyAI/tree/master/gcastle>`_, `GOBNILP <https://bitbucket.org/jamescussens/gobnilp/src/master/>`_, `pcalg <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pcalg/index.html>`_,
`r.blip <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/r.blip/index.html>`_, `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org>`_, `TETRAD <https://www.ccd.pitt.edu/>`_, and `trilearn <https://github.com/felixleopoldo/trilearn>`_    as well as a variety of methods for data generating models and performance evaluation. Alongside user-defined models and randomly
generated datasets, the workflow also includes a number of standard datasets and graphical models from the literature, which may be included in a benchmarking study.
