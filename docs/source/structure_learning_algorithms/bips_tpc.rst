Temporal PC 
---------------


This package implements the tPC algorithm for causal discovery. The 't' stands for 'temporal' or 'tiers' and indicates that background knowledge in the form of a partial node/variable ordering is available. Our implementation is a modified version of pc from the pcalg package (Kalisch et al. 2012) with more :ref:`edge_constraints` supported.

It also supports the Multiple Imputation for Causal Graph Discovery (micd) package.
Which is and add-on to the R package pcalg for handling missing data in contrataint-based causal graph discovery. Supports continuous, discrete and mixed data. Two options are available: 1) gaussCItwd, disCItwd and mixCItwd perform test-wise deletion, where missing observations are deleted as necessary on a test-by-test basis; 2) gaussMItest, disMItest and mixMItest perform conditional independence tests on multiply imputed data. 


.. rubric:: Example 

Config file: `bips_tpc.json <https://github.com/felixleopoldo/benchpress/blob/master/workflow/rules/structure_learning_algorithms/bips_tpc/bips_tpc.json>`_

Command:

.. code:: bash

    snakemake --cores all --use-singularity --configfile workflow/rules/structure_learning_algorithms/bips_tpc/bips_tpc.json

:numref:`bips_tpcplot` and :numref:`bips_tpcplot2`  show FP/P vs. TP/P for pattern graphs and skeletons based on 3 datsets corresponding to 3 realisations of a 20-variables random Gaussian SEM, with an average indegree of 4.
Each dataset contains 10000 samples and has values that are missing not at random (MNAR), sampled using :ref:`mvpc_gen_data`.

.. rubric:: Some fields described 
* ``edgeConstraints`` Name of the JSON file containing :ref:`edge_constraints` 
* ``indepTest`` gaussCItest, binCItest, disCItest, gaussCItwd, disCItwd, mixCItwd, gaussMItest, mixMItest, disMItest 
* ``input_algorithm_id`` When using multiple imputation (MI) i.e. when indepTest is set to gaussMItest, mixMItest, or disMItest, this should be and id of the :ref:`mice <mice>` module. It is a workaround to get imputed data.
