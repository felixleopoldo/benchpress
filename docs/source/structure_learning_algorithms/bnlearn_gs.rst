Grow-shrink 
---------------


The grow-shrink (GS) algorithm is based on the Markov blanket of the nodes in a DAG. For
a specific node, the Markov blanket it the set of nodes which conditioning upon renders it
conditionally independent from all other variables :footcite:t:`margaritis2003learning`. It is a constraint-based
method which estimates the Markov blanket of a node in a two-stage forward-backward proce-
dure using conditional independence tests. The Markov blankets are used to first estimate an
undirected graph and then estimate a DAG in a four-step procedure.
