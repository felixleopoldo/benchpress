Globally optimal Bayesian network learning using integer linear programming 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


GOBNILP is a score based method using integer linear programming (ILP) for learning an optimal DAG
for a Bayesian network with limit on the maximal number of parents for each node. It is a two-stage approach where candidate parent sets for each node are discovered in
the first phase and the optimal sets are determined in a second phase.

.. important:: 

  This module only works on the AMD64 architecture.

.. rubric:: Some fields described 
* ``edgeConstraints`` Name of the JSON file containing background knowledge 
* ``extra_args`` File with extra arguments to pass to the solver. The file should be placed in resources/extra_args and the format is the same as used by gobnilp (see the docs). 
* ``gap_limit`` Gap limit. 
* ``time_limit`` Time limit in seconds for the solver (not including the time to build the score tables). 
* ``timeout`` Use the best DAG found so far after this number of seconds.
