Graphical lasso 
-------------------


Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating sparse graphs by a lasso penalty applied to the inverse covariance matrix. Using a coordinate descent procedure for the lasso, we develop a simple algorithm—the graphical lasso—that is remarkably fast: It solves a 1000-node problem (∼500000 parameters) in at most a minute and is 30–4000 times faster than competing methods. It also provides a conceptual link between the exact problem and the approximation suggested by Meinshausen and Bühlmann (2006). We illustrate the method on some cell-signaling data from proteomics.

.. rubric:: Some fields described 
* ``lambda`` A positive number to control the regularization. Typical usage is to leave the input lambda: null and have the program compute its own. 
* ``nlambda`` The number of regularization/thresholding parameters. The default value is 10 
* ``select_criterion`` Model selection criterion. ric, stars, and ebic are available. The default value is ric.
