The table below contains a list of some of the datasets that are available.
However, to use other datasets, you can simply place them in your local  `resources/data/mydatasets <https://github.com/felixleopoldo/benchpress/tree/master/resources/data/mydatasets>`_ along with the others.
The files should be on the csv format specified in :ref:`data_formats`.
