This module writes ggpairs plots using the `GGally <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGally/index.html#:~:text=GGally%3A%20Extension%20to%20'ggplot2',geometric%20objects%20with%20transformed%20data.>`_ package. 
Be careful that this can be slow and the variable names may not fit into the figure if the dimension is too large.
However, you can always alter the script as you like it.
