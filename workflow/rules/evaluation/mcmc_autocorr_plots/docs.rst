* Fields

  * ``burn_in`` percent [0, 1] to burn of the number of samples. 
  * ``functional`` the currently supported functionals are *size* and graph *score*. 
  * ``thinning`` tells the module to only considering every graph at a given interval length.
  * ``active`` should be set to *false* to deactivate.  
  * ``lags``  the maximum number of lags after ``thinning``.



This module plots the auto-correlation of a functional of the graphs in a MCMC trajectory.

    Auto-correlation of the scores in trajectory of order MCMC

    Auto-correlation of the scores in trajectory of order MCMC for differnt algorithm seeds and parameter settings.


.. note:: 
    
    Bug fix: For this to run, the ``mcmc_traj_plots`` module should also be present in the evaluation section. E.g. ``mcmc_traj_plots=[]``.
