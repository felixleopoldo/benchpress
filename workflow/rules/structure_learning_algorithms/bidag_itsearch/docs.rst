This is a hybrid score-based optimisation technique based on Markov chain Monte Carlo
schemes (Suter et al. 2021; Kuipers et al. 2021). The algorithm starts from a skeleton obtained
through a fast method (e.g. a constraint based method, or GES). Then it performs score and
search on the DAGs belonging to the space defined by the starting skeleton. To correct for
edges which may be missed, the search space is iteratively expanded to include one additional
parent for each variable from outside the current search space. The score and search phase relies
on an MCMC scheme producing a chain of DAGs from their posterior probability given the data.
