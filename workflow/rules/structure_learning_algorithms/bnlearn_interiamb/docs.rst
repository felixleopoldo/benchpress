As in GS, this algorithm is also based on the Markov blanket method to first determine the
undirected skeleton. However, in incremental association Markov blanket (inter-IAMB) the
variable to be included in the Markov blankets are not considered in static order as in GS
and the forward-backward stages are combined into a single procedure, which has the effect of
reducing the size of the blankets.
