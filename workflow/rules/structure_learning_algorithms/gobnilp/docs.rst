Globally optimal Bayesian network learning using integer linear programming (GOBNILP) is a score based method using integer linear programming (ILP) for learning an optimal DAG
for a Bayesian network with limit on the maximal number of parents for each node. It is a two-stage approach where candidate parent sets for each node are discovered in
the first phase and the optimal sets are determined in a second phase.
