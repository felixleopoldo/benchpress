pyAgrum is a scientific C++ and Python library dedicated to Bayesian networks (BN) and other Probabilistic Graphical Models. Based on the C++ aGrUM library, it provides a high-level interface to the C++ part of aGrUM allowing to create, manage and perform efficient computations with Bayesian networks and others probabilistic graphical models : Markov random fields (MRF), influence diagrams (ID) and LIMIDs, credal networks (CN), dynamic BN (dBN), probabilistic relational models (PRM).
