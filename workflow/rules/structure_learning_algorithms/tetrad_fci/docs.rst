From the Tetrad manual: The FCI algorithm is a constraint-based algorithm that takes as input sample data and optional background knowledge and in the large sample limit outputs an equivalence class of CBNs that (including those with hidden confounders) that entail the set of conditional independence relations judged to hold in the population. It is limited to several thousand variables, and on realistic sample sizes it is inaccurate in both adjacencies and orientations. FCI has two phases: an adjacency phase and an orientation phase. The adjacency phase of the algorithm starts with a complete undirected graph and then performs a sequence of conditional independence tests that lead to the removal of an edge between any two adjacent variables that are judged to be independent, conditional on some subset of the observed variables; any conditioning set that leads to the removal of an adjacency is stored. After the adjacency phase, the resulting undirected graph has the correct set of adjacencies, but all of the edges are unoriented. FCI then enters an orientation phase that uses the stored conditioning sets that led to the removal of adjacencies to orient as many of the edges as possible.
