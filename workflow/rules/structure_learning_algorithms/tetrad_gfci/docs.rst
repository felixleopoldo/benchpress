From the TETRAD manual: GFCI is a combination of the FGES :footcite:t:`ramsey2017million` algorithm and the FCI algorithm :footcite:t:`spirtes1993discovery` that improves upon the accuracy and efficiency of FCI. In order to understand the basic methodology of GFCI, it is necessary to understand some basic facts about the FGES and FCI algorithms. 
The FGES algorithm is used to improve the accuracy of both the adjacency phase and the orientation phase of FCI by providing a more accurate initial graph that contains a subset of both the non-adjacencies and orientations of the final output of FCI. The initial set of nonadjacencies given by FGES is augmented by FCI performing a set of conditional independence tests that lead to the removal of some further adjacencies whenever a conditioning set is found that makes two adjacent variables independent. After the adjacency phase of FCI, some of the orientations of FGES are then used to provide an initial orientation of the undirected graph that is then augmented by the orientation phase of FCI to provide additional orientations.
